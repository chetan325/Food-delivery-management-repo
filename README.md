# Food Delivary Management System (DBMS-Project)
I  have developed a food delivery management system utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a database. 
This system enables users to browse menus, place orders, and track delivery status.
It features a user-friendly interface and efficient backend processing to ensure seamless operation. 
The integrated database ensures secure and organized data management for orders and customer information.
